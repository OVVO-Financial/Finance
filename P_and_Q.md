# Illustrative Example: Why `NNS.rescale()` is Necessary

Let’s say you’re modeling stock prices and need to ensure your simulated data aligns with financial theory or practical constraints. Here’s an example to illustrate why `NNS.rescale()` is valuable:

## Scenario
You’ve generated a set of terminal stock prices over 1 year in a manner reminiscent of a geometric Brownian motion (though not a full risk-neutral GBM). This example simply illustrates how `NNS.rescale()` can adjust such simulated data so that the mean aligns with a theoretical expectation (e.g., risk-neutral pricing):
```r
> set.seed(1234) 
> prices <- 100 * exp(cumsum(rnorm(100, 0.001, 0.02)))
> mean(prices) 
[1] 78.41677
```

- Initial price = 100
- Risk-free rate = 0.05
- Time to maturity = 1 year

In a risk-neutral world (common in options pricing), the expected value of the terminal prices should be approximately 105.13 (calculated as the initial price adjusted by the risk-free rate over time), not 78.42. 
This exaggerated discrepancy arises because the simulation’s mean depends on random draws and an arbitrary drift, not a risk-neutral framework.

## Without Rescaling
If you use these prices directly in a pricing model, your results won’t align with the theoretical framework, leading to mispriced options or inaccurate risk assessments.

## With `NNS.rescale()`
Using the risk-neutral method, you could now run: 
```r
> rescaled <- NNS.rescale(prices, a = 100, b = 0.05, method = "riskneutral", T = 1, type = "Terminal")
> mean(rescaled)
[1] 105.1271   
```
The function adjusts the entire distribution so its mean matches the expected value of 105.13, keeping the shape of the data intact while meeting the risk-neutral requirement.  Alternatively, if you’re working with discounted values and need the mean to match the initial price of 100, you could use:
```r
> rescaled_discounted <- NNS.rescale(prices, a = 100, b = 0.05, method = "riskneutral", T = 1, type = "Discounted")
> mean(rescaled_discounted)
[1] 100
```

## Why It’s Necessary
- **Flexibility**: The same function handles both min-max scaling (e.g., normalizing to [0, 1] for machine learning) and risk-neutral adjustments (critical for finance).
- **Consistency**: Ensures simulated or empirical data aligns with theoretical models.
- **Practicality**: Simplifies workflows by embedding these adjustments into a single, reusable tool.

This makes `NNS.rescale()` a must-have for anyone juggling data normalization and financial modeling!

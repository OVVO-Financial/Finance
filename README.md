# Finance Research Notes

This repository collects working papers, analytical notebooks, and reproducible code that explore [Nonlinear Nonparametric Statistics (NNS)](https://github.com/OVVO-Financial/NNS) tools for portfolio construction, risk management, and derivative pricing.

## Document Abstracts

### NNS_MFE.md
A modern restatement of mathematical finance foundations through the lens of Nonlinear Nonparametric Statistics. The paper replaces parametric stochastic differential equation machinery with empirical distributions, partial-moment valuation, and pathwise risk-neutral rescaling to deliver a fully data-driven pricing and risk measurement pipeline that still respects martingale constraints.

### LPM_rank_cors.md
Demonstrates how to source current S&P 500 constituents, compute log returns, and evaluate the concordance between tail-sensitive risk measures. The analysis contrasts expected regret of drawdown, conditional drawdown at risk, conditional value at risk, and lower partial moments to highlight ranking differences driven by asymmetry.

### P_and_Q.md
Illustrates why `NNS.rescale()` is required when simulated price paths must satisfy theoretical expectations under different probability measures. The worked example shows how the function enforces risk-neutral and discounted constraints without distorting the empirical distribution.

### SD_cluster.md
Compares stochastic dominance clustering with Hierarchical Risk Parity and na√Øve equal weighting in an out-of-sample asset allocation setting. The workflow extracts S&P 500 data, constructs NNS stochastic dominance clusters, and contrasts their performance with conventional portfolio construction heuristics.

### stress_test.md
Outlines a stress-testing framework that confines analysis to the downside co-lower partial moment quadrant while preserving nonlinear dependence through `NNS.reg()`. Bootstrapped replicates and dependence diagnostics ensure scenario paths respect empirical joint behavior when targeting adverse market moves.
